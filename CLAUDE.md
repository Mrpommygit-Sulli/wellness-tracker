# CLAUDE.md — Wellness Tracker

## Project Purpose

A personal wellness tracking system that accepts plain text inputs throughout
the day — training sessions, meals, Whoop data — and processes them through a
multi-agent pipeline to build a structured daily diary entry. At the end of the
week, daily entries are synthesised into a weekly progress report tracking
training objectives and calorie deficit against targets.

This project is also a learning vehicle for agentic AI patterns implemented in
Python. Every architectural decision reflects a deliberate pattern choice, not
just the simplest path to working code.

## Architecture Overview

### Entry Points

Five CLI commands via `main.py`:

```
python main.py --set-objectives     # Set weekly goals (run once Monday)
python main.py --whoop "<text>"     # Log morning Whoop strain target
python main.py --log "<text>"       # Log a training session or meal
python main.py --close "<text>"     # End of day close with confirmed totals
python main.py --report             # Generate weekly progress report
```

## Agentic Patterns

This project implements six agentic patterns. Every implementation decision
should preserve these patterns — do not shortcut them.

**Specialised Agents**
Each agent has one responsibility, one input contract, one output contract.
Agents do not call other agents. Agents do not fetch their own data.

**Federated Agents**
Agents share a context envelope (DailyEnvelope). Each agent receives a scoped
payload extracted from the envelope by the orchestrator. Each agent appends its
output to the envelope. The envelope is the single source of truth.

**Least-Privilege**
No agent receives the full envelope. The orchestrator extracts only the fields
each agent needs. Agents have no file system or API access beyond the LLM call.

**Deterministic Guardrails**
All safety and business rules are Python functions, not prompt instructions.
Four types: input, output, policy, dependency. All return a GuardrailResult
with rule name, version, result, reason, and action. All results are recorded
in the audit trail.

**Human-in-the-Loop**
Escalations surface in the terminal as structured handoff packages. The user
selects from bounded decision options. The decision and the full context the
user saw are recorded in the audit trail before the workflow resumes.

**Audit-Grade Accountability**
Every significant event writes one record to a JSONL audit file. Records are
hash-chained — each record contains the hash of the previous record. Chain
integrity can be verified via `python main.py --verify-audit <date>`.

## Data Model Summary

### DailyEnvelope
The shared context object. One per day. Persisted to `data/diary/YYYY-MM-DD.json`
after every agent run.

Key sections:
- `envelope_id`, `date`, `status` (in_progress | finalised)
- `weekly_objectives` — loaded at start of day, referenced throughout
- `whoop` — strain target and actuals
- `training_sessions` — list, grows during day
- `meals` — list, grows during day
- `daily_totals` — recalculated after every accumulator run
- `agent_outputs` — append-only record of every agent invocation
- `flags` — raised by validation and guardrails
- `escalations` — HITL events and decisions
- `audit_trail` — append-only, hash-chained

### WeeklyObjectives
Set once on Monday. Loaded by orchestrator for every subsequent input that week.
Stored in `data/objectives/week_YYYY-MM-DD.json`.

Key sections:
- `weight_goal` — direction, target weekly deficit kcal, current weight
- `training_targets` — per activity: sessions, min duration
- `nutrition_targets` — daily calorie target, daily protein target
- `constraints` — free text list (injury notes, travel days)

## Key Conventions

**Agent output contracts**
Every agent returns a typed Pydantic model. Raw LLM output is always parsed
and validated before being written to the envelope. If parsing fails, the
guardrail layer rejects the output — the envelope is never updated with
unvalidated data.

**Guardrail results**
Every guardrail function returns a `GuardrailResult` with:
- `passed: bool`
- `rule_name: str`
- `rule_version: str`
- `reason: str | None`
- `action: Literal["proceed", "note", "escalate", "reject"]`

**Audit records**
Every audit record contains:
- `sequence_number`, `timestamp`, `event_type`
- `actor` (agent ID + version, or "human" + reviewer ID)
- `payload` (what was recorded)
- `previous_hash`, `record_hash`

**Envelope persistence**
The envelope is written to disk after every agent run — not just at end of day.
If the process is interrupted, the envelope reflects the last completed agent.

**Prompts**
Prompts live in `src/wellness_tracker/prompts/` as YAML files.
Loaded via `importlib.resources` — never via relative Path strings.
Each YAML file must include `agent_id`, `version`, `system_prompt`,
and `max_tokens`.
Bump `version` when prompt content changes.
Only prompts required for the current slice are added —
never speculatively for future slices.

YAML prompt files must be declared in `pyproject.toml` to ensure they
are included when the package is installed:
```toml
[tool.setuptools.package-data]
"wellness_tracker.prompts" = ["*.yaml"]
```

**Testing LLM calls**
Unit and integration tests never call the real LLM. All LLM calls are mocked
via `unittest.mock.patch`. Canned responses live in `tests/fixtures/llm_responses.py`.
E2E tests call the real API and are gated behind `@pytest.mark.e2e`.

**mypy pragmatic mode**
All models, guardrail functions, and orchestrator logic are fully typed.
Agent output parsing may use `Any` where Pydantic handles runtime validation.
`# type: ignore` comments must include a reason.

## Known Setup Issues

**UV src layout — ModuleNotFoundError**

UV src layout requires three things in `pyproject.toml` to work correctly:

```toml
[tool.setuptools.packages.find]
where = ["src"]

[tool.setuptools.package-dir]
"" = "src"

[tool.uv]
package = true
```

Without all three, `uv run` may fail with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module
named 'wellness_tracker'` even when the `.pth` file exists.

If this occurs, confirm all three are present in `pyproject.toml` then run:

```bash
rm -rf .venv && rm -f uv.lock && uv sync
```

## Running the Project

```bash
# Initialise with UV
uv sync

# Set up pre-commit hooks
uv run pre-commit install

# Run all unit and integration tests
uv run pytest tests/unit tests/integration

# Run E2E tests (requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in .env)
uv run pytest tests/e2e --run-e2e

# Verify audit trail integrity for a specific date
uv run python -m wellness_tracker.main --verify-audit 2026-06-27
```
